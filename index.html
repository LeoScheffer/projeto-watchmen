                    Some say he’s just a man in a mask — others believe he’s justice itself, walking in flesh.
                    His face never changes, yet it’s never the same. Always shifting… like the truth he seeks.
                    He sees the world in black and white, good and evil — no in-between. And when the city sleeps, he
                    watches. Waiting. Judging.
                    Writing it all down in his journal. If you're guilty, pray he doesn't come knocking.
                    Because once he finds you… there’s no mask to hide behind.</p>

                    They call her Silk Spectre, but that’s only a name.
                    Beneath the silk and shadows is a woman torn between legacy and freedom.
                    Raised in the glow of someone else’s spotlight, trained to be more than a symbol.
                    She smiles for the cameras, but her fists speak louder. Some say she’s running from the past.
                    Others say she’s carving a new future. One thing is certain: underestimate her, and you’ll learn
                    that silk can cut deeper than steel.</p>

                    They call him Dr. Manhattan, but names mean little to a god.
                    His skin glows like a star, his eyes see what no one else can.
                    He walks among us, yet exists far beyond. Detached. Infinite. Unstoppable. Some fear him. Some
                    worship him.
                    But he feels nothing. Because when you’ve seen the end of everything… what meaning can there be in
                    anything?</p>

                    The Comedian — a man who wore war like a second skin and smiled through the chaos.
                    To him, life was never about justice or peace — it was a cruel joke, and he was the only one in on
                    the punchline.
                    Brutal. Unfiltered. Unapologetic. He saw the world for what it was — broken, bleeding, absurd — and
                    played his part with a grin and a loaded gun.
                    Heroes hated him. Politicians used him. But in the end, maybe he was the only one who truly
                    understood the joke.</p>

                        thrown from his apartment window, silenced in a world he once mocked.
                        To the public, he was a decorated hero. To those who knew him, a symbol of chaos wrapped in
                        stars and stripes. But someone wanted him gone… someone who knew too much.
                        Blood on the badge, shattered glass on the pavement — and behind it all, a secret that could
                        unravel everything.</p>

                        inside.
                        With only his journal, instinct, and a mask that never blinks, Rorschach pieces together a
                        conspiracy tied to the murder of the Comedian.
                        Every clue pulls him deeper — into secrets the world was never meant to uncover. Justice isn't
                        blind.

                        Set by scientists, ignored by nations — each second closer to midnight echoes humanity’s failure
                        to change.
                        In the shadows, powers move. Heroes fall. Truth bends.
                        As the hands creep forward, one question remains: is it too late to turn them back… or has the
                        clock already struck?</p>
